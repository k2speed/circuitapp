# CircuitSlide

CircuitSlide is a simple slide puzzle game. It combines the learning of circuitry and electronics in general with the joy of solving a tough puzzle.<br>
<br>
As of the current version, only a single level has been released; with respect to it being a prototype.<br> But more levels and features are expected to be released in the near future.<br>
<br>
CircuitSlide is also my first "Big" project using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).<br>
CircuitSlide has been made to support both desktop and mobile devices.
